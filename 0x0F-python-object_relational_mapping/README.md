# Python - Object Relational Mappers

ORMs are libraries that automate the transfer of data stored in relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL etc) tables into objects that are more commonly used.
Instead of writing SQL statements, one just needs a module that performs that abstraction e.g SQLAlchemy in Python.

In this project, `MySQLdb` is initially used to make the abstraction of ORMs clear so that as progress is made in the tasks, one begins to understand how the knowledge of OOP is useful in working with ORMs.

These subjects are of interest in this project:

- SQL
- ORMs
- OOP
