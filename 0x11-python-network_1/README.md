#	Python - HTTP, API, and libraries

This project focuses on using python libraries ```urllib```  and ```requests``` for parsing urls and HTTP methods. HTTP concepts have been discussed and practiced in the first part of the [Python_Network_projects](https://github.com/Taiwopeter-babs/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x10-python-network_0)
